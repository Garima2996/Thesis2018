Milestone 2: Project Outline

To help me plan and conduct research for my thesis project, I will be using the Semi-Structured Qualitative Study (SSQS) research methodology as formulated by designers at the Interaction Design Foundation. The following flowchart offers a checklist that will help me to plan and conduct my research, and also compare my progress against. It also incorporates stages that will allow me to iterate, revise, add to my research and enrich my final findings.

**SQSS Research Checklist**

SQSS checklist and project outline:

1. General research questions – Sept 2018

    – At this stage, I will list the questions I hope my thesis research will eventually answer, and prepare a thesis statement that will guide rest of the research work.

2. Select relevant subjects – Sept 2018

    – At this stage, I will be making a list of all the relevant topics I want to research on and conduct an desktop research to find credible and useful research papers and other resources.

3. Collect relevant data – October 2018

    – The next step will be to start populating an annotated bibliography based on the readings.

    – I will be reading research papers on the following topics:

        a. History of EE in the US

        b. Pedagogies and curricula in EE

        c. Theories in EE

        d. Goals and standards in EE

        e. Use of technology in EE

    – I will also be reaching out to professors and professionals in my network to gain access to EE classrooms and learning environments. If this is successful, I might add a case study stage within my plan.

    – I'll also begin preparing a draft for the introduction and background of the paper around now, based on literature I have collected and the plans outlined for the research work.

4. Preparing literature review – November 2018

    – November will be spent doing a lot of reading and populating the annotated bibliography. I hope to finish the literature review by the end of this month.

    – Based on the readings, I will prepare my first draft of conceptual framework.  This framework will act as the backbone of my research paper. I’ll be reviewing the literature I have collected till this point and reflect how it fits within the proposed conceptual framework.

5. Case study and theoretical framework – November and December 2018

    – Hopefully, I am able to connect with teachers using different EE curricula and I am able to attend their classrooms to observe the content, conversations, and interaction between the students and teachers to do a case study.

    – Based on the literature review, I'll begin preparing a theoretical framework for my paper at this time.

    – Tighter specification of question – This will be the iterative stage of my research plan. Based on the research and interpretations made till this point, I will review:

            a. My research questions and thesis pitch

            b. Data quality and if I need to collect literature/data from more sources.

7. Organise and analyse data from case study – December 2019

    – At this stage, I will begin analysing the data I gather from the case studies.

    – I might also look at more literature to add to my research at this point.

8. Conceptual framework; analysis and synthesis; critique; interpretation and recommendation (literature and case studies) – January, February, March, and April 2019

    – Next steps will be analysing and synthesising all data collected (literature review and case studies).

    – Based on the observations I make, I will also attempt to prepare a conceptual framework and link it with the theoretical framework I have already.

    – Adding my critique and interpretation on the data, as well as making recommendations will be the last steps before I start preparing the final scholarly paper.

10. Write findings in final paper – April and May 2019
