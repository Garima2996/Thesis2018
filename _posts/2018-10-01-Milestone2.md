Milestone 2: Project Outline

To help me plan and conduct research for my thesis project, I will be using the Semi-Structured Qualitative Study (SSQS) research methodology as formulated by designers at the Interaction Design Foundation. The following flowchart offers a checklist that will help me to plan and conduct my research, and also compare my progress against. It also incorporates stages that will allow me to iterate, revise, add to my research and enrich my final findings.

SQSS checklist and project outline:

1. General research questions – Sept 2018
    – At this stage, I will list the questions I hope my thesis research will eventually answer, and prepare a thesis statement that will guide rest of the research work.

2. Select relevant subjects – Sept 2018
    – At this stage, I will be making a list of all the relevant topics I want to research on and conduct an desktop research to find credible and useful research papers and other resources.

3. Collect relevant data – October 2018
    – The next step will be to start populating an annotated bibliography based on the readings.
    – I will be reading research papers on the following topics:
        a. History of EE in the US and India
        b. Goals and standards in EE
        c. Teacher training in EE
    – I will also be reaching out to professors and professionals in my network to gain access to EE classrooms and learning environments. If this is successful, I might add a case study stage within my plan.

4. Interpret data – October 2018
    – Based on the research I am able to conduct (paper and case study), at this stage I will be reviewing all the data collected and make interpretations.

5. Propose conceptual framework – October and November 2018
    – I will be reading relevant papers on the following topics:
        a. Theories in learning and technology enabled learning environments
        b. Theories in EE
    – Based on the readings, I will prepare my first draft of conceptual framework.  This framework will act as the backbone of my research paper. I’ll be reviewing the literature I have collected till this point and reflect how it fits within the proposed conceptual framework.

6. Tighter specification of question – November 2018
    – This will be the iterative stage of my research plan. Based on the research and interpretations made till this point, I will review:
        a. My research questions and thesis pitch
        b. Data quality and if I need to collect literature/data from more sources.

7. Collect more data as needed – February 2019
    – At this stage, I will be collecting more data as detailed in my review from the previous step.
    – I might be adding more sources for data collection and literature research.

8. Interpret data – March 2019
    – At this stage, I will collect all data (annotated bibliography and case studies) and make interpretations.

9. Final conceptual framework – March 2019
    – Review and revise the conceptual framework as needed.

10. Write findings – April 2019
    – Finalise all data and write final findings.
