Refining Ideas

(In this revision of Milestone 1, I have tried to refocus and refine my original idea into a more cohesive form. While reading my original M1, I felt that it would be difficult to clearly describe and analyse the value judgement issues/complexities relating to my topic (education and behaviour modification) and instead change the angle of my inquiry to be more about effective teaching and learning.)

My graduate thesis project will be a scholarly inquiry paper investigating the current state of environmental education in schools and its impact, as well as the role of technology in this space and how it can be leveraged in improving the impact of environmental education.

Global warming and climate change have been issues that the world has been struggling with for a some decades now. In the US, widespread concern for the environment became prominent and caught the public eye around the 1970s, and one of the efforts by policymakers to educate and make the future citizens more aware about the need and ways to protect the environment was to introduce environmental education (EE) in schools. However, after almost 50 years, we are still grappling with the same fundamental environmental issues (clean air and water, biodiversity loss, melting glaciers, coastal flooding) that were identified decades back.

This makes me wonder about the role that environmental education (EE) plays as one of the efforts in the fight against environmental degradation. I am curious to know how effective EE is? How is EE being taught in schools (focusing specifically on grade 4, 8, and 12), and what is the impact on students’ understanding of current environmental issues? Is technology being used in EE, and, if yes, what are its affordances? Can technology be leveraged further to improve EE?

Through my research, I hope to find out about the current state of environmental education in the US and India (my home country, ), and the direction it is heading in, and finally make informed suggestions for educators and decision-makers to consider to improve/enrich environmental education. Ideally, the final goal of this thesis project would be to develop a resource for educators to discover ways to enrich and/or improve their current EE curriculum.
