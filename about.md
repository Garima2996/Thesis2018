My name is Garima, and I am a Masters student in the educational technology program at NYU Steinhardt.

I will be documenting my research, reflections, and write-ups on this website as I work on my Masters thesis during Fall 2018 and Spring 2019. The thesis is a scholarly inquiry paper on a topic that I am very passionate about â€“ Environmental literacy and awareness. I am curious to find out the connections between environmental education, behaviour change and modification, and environmental consciousness.

Through this exploratory process, I hope to learn more about the scale and scope of environmental education (EE) in the public schools in the US (New York City specifically), how EE has developed over the last few decades, the various curriculums and popular practices adopted by teachers these days, and how technology can be used to leverage the positive effects of EE for improved learning.

The audience for my scholarly paper are mainly educators and the people who influence the work carried out by educators (for example, educational administrators, reformers and policy makers).
