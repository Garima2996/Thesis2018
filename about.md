My name is Garima, and I am a Masters student in the educational technology program at NYU Steinhardt.

I will be documenting my research, reflections, and write-ups on this website as I work on my Masters thesis during Fall 2018 and Spring 2019. The thesis is a scholarly inquiry paper on a topic that I am very passionate about â€“ Environmental literacy and awareness. I am curious to find out the connections between education, behaviour change and modification, and environmental consciousness.
Through this journey, I hope to find out why is it that we have been learning about the environment and its importance in our school for many decades and yet we are still grappling with very basic global warming issues?
